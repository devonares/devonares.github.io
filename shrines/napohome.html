			<p>Welcome, fellow lurker, to my personal E-shrine of Ikemen Vampire's Napoleon Bonaparte. 
			This shrine will hold all my Napoleon treasures, including my fanarts, links to fics, and my general ramblings of him.</p>
			<p>Use the navigation bar on the left to quickly jump past these rambles and on to the good stuff.</p>
			<h2> What's Ikevamp?</h2>
			<p>It's short for Ikemen Vampire. It's one of Cybird's 'Ikemen Series' releases, their collection of Otome (dating simulation) games.
			This one game in particular has historical figures made into hot anime boys that you can date, and they're also vampires!</p>
			<h2>Why?</h2>
			<p>Uhhh.... I started playing this game semi-ironically, while I was bored in highschool. Of course, like most things, it did not stay ironic.</p>
			<p>It combines my historical nerdery with my thrist for romantic stories very nicely, so in a while I grew obsessed, particularly with this one
			character, which is based on the real Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
			<p>Although he has his namesake, they really just made up his personality entirely (just like the other historical figures that also exists in this game.)
			You'll find that all these characters are actually pretty entertaining to see together.</p>
			<h2>The Characters</h2>
			<center><img src="../images/characters.jpg"></center>
			<p>Whoah. there's a lot of them isn't there.</p>
			<p>This shrine isn't really about ikevamp as a whole and I'm pretty sure anyone that manages to find me here already knows about this game...however.
			Just for old times sake. These boys are, from above, left to right:</p>
			<p>William Shakespeare, Johann Georg Faust, Vlad, Charles-Henri Sanson, Sebastian.</p>
			<p>Jean d'Arc, Theodorus van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Comte de St Germain, Dazai Osamu.</p>
			<p>Arthur C Doyle, Leonardo Da Vinci, Napoleon Bonaparte (our boy), Mozart, Isaac Newton.</p>
			<h2>Lore</h2>
			<p>Each of these characters, particularly characters on the middle and bottom row, are dead in their respective era but have asked to be revived again as a vampire.
			 The one that revives them is the Lord of the Mansion, Comte de St Germain</p>
			<p>St. Germain is a Greater Vampire. Greater basically means they are born a vampire and lives for eternity. It is almost impossible for them to get killed. They're
			also the only one with the ability to turn people into vampires.</p>
			<p>The rest of the guys depicted here are Lesser vampires, meaning they were originally human but they've been turned, giving them longer life (quoted, "a taste of eternity") and stronger physique. They're
			harder to kill, but can still die.</p>
			<p>The men on the top row are special, because they could be counted as the 'villains' of the game--except for Sebastian, who is a mortal human just living with us on the mansion. 
				
			<p>Vlad, the white haired
			one, is another Greater Vampire. Greater vampires are basically sort of... archaic beings that have lived thousands of years. Some of them could time travel (Vlad and the Comte being one), making them wise to the world.</p>
			<p>Vlad and the Comte stands on opposite sides, and each has a different ideology regarding humans and their civilization. But it could be argued that both ideas came from the same source: a love for them.</p>
			<p>The Comte loves humanity, and he is willing to support, accomodate, and observe their achievments. Vlad too, but he has apparently seen the future where the world was going to be destroyed (remember
			his time traveling capabilities). He wanted to control humanity and direct them in the right way (his way.) These two sides are, to be honest, pretty lazy in continuing their conflict, because during most 
			of the game they are pretty much just chilling.</p>
			<p>The player, us, have accidentally stumbled into a time-traveling doorway and into this mansion located in 19th Century France. You're stuck for at least a month there, so you have time to get to know one of these
			boys, and perhaps fall in love.</p>
			
			<h2>The Fandom</h2>
			<p>The fandom is my favourite thing about this game and why I've been playing for so long. It's quite small, not all that visible, but tight-knit if you know where to look, and incredibly creative. The writing community
			of this fandom is especially stellar for only a small part of the Otome community. A lot of my internet friends are from this fandom :) hi guys <3. </p>
			
			<h2>On to Napoleon</h2>
			<p>He's the poster boy of the game, so, typically, he has an all around likeable and charismatic personality. Some would
			say he's boring and not interesting that way, but I disagree. Obviously. </p>
			<p>While he is kind to you, he often went about it in an rude and awkward way. He likes to tease and chide you, as well as call you stupid (affectionate).
			He's also often overly serious, making him bad at understanding jokes made at his expense, AND having some really bad dad-quality jokes himself. 
			This is making him the ultimate "that guy" of the game, in my opinion.</p>
			<p>For the other characters, he's basically the older bro of the mansion. He is reliable, has leader-like qualities, *and* fighting capabilites. The coolest guy around.</p>

			<h2>So why are we here?</h2>
			<p>WELL, besides just to suffer, we are here to have fun with some Napoleon fan-content. So I've taken the time to collect them, over the course of my time being on this fandom.</p>
