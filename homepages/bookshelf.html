			<h2>2/12/2023 Babylon</h2>
			<p>I watched <b>Babylon (2022)</b> with a friend recently. It's a ridiculous movie for sure, but I don't watch these weird films 
				often, so it certainly a new thing for me. It's like 3 hour long movie (like most goddamn movies these days), but I'm captivated the whole
				way through, most of the time by the grossness and hotness and the overall fuckery of it. I love that vibes. Like your brain being
				pushed through a meat grinder. 
			<p>Anyway, I don't like the female suffering being played as comedy here and there. Although I get the point. The film is hilarious, in a fucked up
				way, because it's trying to serve the audience the nightmarish hell that is the film industry. It can't really be presented in any other way but through 
				comedy, because otherwise you're just going to be horrified all the time, which is not fun, nor livable. 
			<p>My interpretation of the message of the movie is that,
				despite the hellish conditions and the hellish people, ultimately cinema as a whole is a bigger Thing than them. 
				And their sacrifices created beautiful things. It's fucked up, really. What does that say about beautiful things?
				
			<p>If anyone wants to give it a watch, I won't recommend it too much. It's quite filled with triggering content. It's one of those films I won't 
				admit to having watched lmao. Mostly because people around me are prudes, but also because it's quite a spicy meatball.
			<p>Nevertheless, my friend is a cool one. I look forward to hanging out with her more (she's an old friend of mine I haven't talked to
				in a while.)
