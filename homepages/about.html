			<p>Hello, I'm Devon. You might also know me by my username batteryrose. I suck at describing myself,
			so if you know me I'm sure you already have your own impression of me... and if you don't, then I would prefer
			it that way.</p>
			<p>I like to draw, that's about the only skill I'm confident of in this life. I also write sometimes. 
			I'm probably known for my fandom fanarts, especially around the 'otome games' sphere. I built my following in the Cybird Ikemen Series
			fandom, particularly as Ikemen Vampire's Napoleon content factory. Met most of my internet friends there, good times.</p>
			<p>Anyway, I'm studying information technology, so I know a thing or two about making websites. Somehow despite absolutely 
				despising it I also Love using pure HTML/CSS. There's a kind of organized chaos being made in coding a website from scratch. 
				I thrive in organized chaos.
			</p>
			<p>Social media companies have been unreliable lately. I'd love it if personal websites are making a comeback. So, I'm joining in the
				movement. I'll be glad to assist others in joining in the movement too.
			</p>
			<p>That's enough about me. Wait, no, there's a little more.</p>
