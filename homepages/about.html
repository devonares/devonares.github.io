			<p>Hello, I'm devon. Or nares. Or nana. You might also know me by my username batteryrose. I suck at describing myself,
			so if you know me I'm sure you already have your own impression of me... and if you don't, then I would prefer
			it that way.</p>
			<p>I like to draw, that's about the only skill I'm confident of in this life. I also write, but I'm never sure about that one.
			I'm probably known for my fandom fanarts, especially around the 'otome games' sphere. I built my following in the Cybird Ikemen Series
			fandom, particularly as Ikemen Vampire's Napoleon content factory. Met most of my internet friends here! Good times.
			Aside from art my fics are also out there, I guess, but I don't make as many of 'em.</p>
			<p>Pretty much, I'm someone that gets overly, brainrotted-ly obsessed by something. Often to a detriment. It'll either last years or just a
			couple of days. I've no control of it. Lately I've adopted a 'let myself go with the flow' sort of philosophy, so I'd just let whatever other
			forces commanding my mind to do whatever it wants. Write a website from scratch instead of preparing for tomorrow's midterms? Totally. 
			Do I regret and despise myself for completely bombing the exam? I try not to.</p>
			<p>What else... ah right. I don't go out, or move around often. I'm trying to fix that. Otherwise these bones won't last my middle ages. See,
			I <i>do</i> try to improve myself sometimes.</p>
			<p>That's enough about me. Wait, no, there's a little more.</p>
