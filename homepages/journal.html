                <p>Suffering. Felt like I haven't talked to anyone in years (only been on my laptop for two days tinkering on this website) 
                    Honestly tho I genuinely think for each line of code I wrote, that's a minus on my social capabilites. It's now in 
                    the negatives. Last day at work some guests asked me a question and not a single coherent word was produced from my mouth.
                    tbh i also think people shouldn't ask questions to someone that is clearly working and focusing on something smh smh
