<h1>FANFICTION</h1>	
<p>For my fics, currently I will still link to my tumblr masterlist, but I plan to host them on this website eventually.</p>
<p>I write for Ikemen Vampire and Ikemen Prince but I deal more with my own OCs, historical references, and pure self-indulgence. Also mostly m/m.</p>

<h1>INTERACTIVE FICTION</h1>	
<p>I also dabble on writing interactive fiction, which I host on github. You can play them in your browser directly through these links.</p>

<p><i>Based on my ikepri fic of the same title, but players do not need to know ikemen prince to play it.</i></p>
